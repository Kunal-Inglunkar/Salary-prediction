### Salary Prediction for Data Science roles

Our smart questions:
1) Does salary estimate vary between the states in the USA and data science roles (job titles, description)?
2) Is the salary estimate in the US correlated with revenue of the company?
3) Does the salary estimate in the US depend on the industry and the sector?

For modeling, we will try to predict the average salary of the data science roles.
