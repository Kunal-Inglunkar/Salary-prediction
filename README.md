### Salary Prediction for Data Science roles

Data science combines multiple disciplines like math, statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning which helps to uncover actionable insights hidden in data. According to the Harvard Business Review (2022), the amount of data, analytics, and AI in business and society seem unlikely to decline, therefore, data scientist jobs will only continue to grow in its importance. Hence, knowing the factors that affect the salary estimate will be beneficial for professionals working in this field. 

Our smart questions:
1) Does salary estimate vary between the states in the USA and data science roles (job titles, description)?
2) Is the salary estimate in the US correlated with revenue of the company?
3) Does the salary estimate in the US depend on the industry and the sector?

For modeling, we will try to predict the average salary of the data science roles.
